# Max-Network-Flow
conducting an study to see which of the network flow algorithms is better than the others. A goal is to figure out for what kinds of graphs one algorithm does better than the others. The algorithms will implement and run experiments on are: the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm , the scaling Ford-Fulkerson algorithm ,and the preflow-push algorithm
